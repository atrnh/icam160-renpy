## This section contains information about how to build your project into
## distribution files.
init python:

    ## The name that's used for directories and archive files. For example, if
    ## this is 'mygame-1.0', the windows distribution will be in the
    ## directory 'mygame-1.0-win', in the 'mygame-1.0-win.zip' file.
    build.directory_name = "SocialMediaSimulatorDemo-1"

    ## The name that's uses for executables - the program that users will run
    ## to start the game. For example, if this is 'mygame', then on Windows,
    ## users can click 'mygame.exe' to start the game.
    build.executable_name = "Social Media Simulator Demo"

    ## If True, Ren'Py will include update information into packages. This
    ## allows the updater to run.
    build.include_update = False

    ## File patterns:
    ##
    ## The following functions take file patterns. File patterns are case-
    ## insensitive, and matched against the path relative to the base
    ## directory, with and without a leading /. If multiple patterns match,
    ## the first is used.
    ##
    ##
    ## In a pattern:
    ##
    ## /
    ##     Is the directory separator.
    ## *
    ##     Matches all characters, except the directory separator.
    ## **
    ##     Matches all characters, including the directory separator.
    ##
    ## For example:
    ##
    ## *.txt
    ##     Matches txt files in the base directory.
    ## game/**.ogg
    ##     Matches ogg files in the game directory or any of its subdirectories.
    ## **.psd
    ##    Matches psd files anywhere in the project.

    ## Classify files as None to exclude them from the built distributions.

    build.classify('**~', None)
    build.classify('**.bak', None)
    build.classify('**/.**', None)
    build.classify('**/#**', None)
    build.classify('**/thumbs.db', None)
    build.classify('**.png', None)

    ## To archive files, classify them as 'archive'.

    # build.classify('game/**.png', 'archive')
    # build.classify('game/**.jpg', 'archive')

    ## Files matching documentation patterns are duplicated in a mac app
    ## build, so they appear in both the app and the zip file.

    build.documentation('*.html')
    build.documentation('*.txt')
